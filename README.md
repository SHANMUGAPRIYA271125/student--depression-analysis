# 🧠 Student Depression Analysis
This project aims to analyze student depression levels using a dataset collected from students based on various personal, academic, and social factors. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that can help in understanding student mental health better.
## 📌 Objective
To perform **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and apply **regression models** to understand the key factors contributing to student depression.
## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes features such as:
- Age, Gender
- Academic stress, Sleep hours, Social life
- Parental support, Financial issues
- Depression level (target variable)
## 🧪 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data wrangling
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for regression models
## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed
- Handling missing and noisy data
- Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis
- Data visualization (heatmaps, bar charts, histograms)
- Regression modeling (Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression)
- Prediction of depression levels
## 💡 Insights
- Academic stress and sleep hours showed strong correlation with depression levels.
- Financial issues and lack of support also played a significant role.
- Regression models helped identify key influencing factors.

`STUDENT_DEPRESSION_ANALYSIS.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with full code and analysis
## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Use classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Add more survey data for deeper analysis
- Deploy as an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Tableau
